# perl is simply the best scripting language

WTF, I literally had the best experience while traveling to another city, I
decided to create a fuzzy find simple script for my workflow in perl And bonus:
with no internet, just man pages 

Result: I manage to finish 60% of the script(finished when got internet access
with few searches) with *no* previous perl knowledge at all, just reading man
pages and writing.

Why people don't value this stuff? I don't get it the hate that perl receives
when it's so much productive

Like wtf, it's a real language compared to [bash]() not saying that bash is bad
or something, bash is good for some stuff, beyond that you *should* use perl
wtf.

Stop following those twitter trends and learn useful stuff.
