# i think I'm really into Perl right now

Like for real, Perl regular expressions are just magical, it's like having an `awk` and a `sed` both together and with waaay more power
And besides the awesome regular expressions, it's an awesome scripting language for rapid prototyping! 
Like what? what other languages has this type of strong points

And as it's not good enough, Perl is just default for every Unix systems so I can use without any fear, it's simply amazing right now
