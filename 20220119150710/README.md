# payment method for remarquer

## Summary

Remarquer(the application for notes with zettelkasten)

## Idea

I think that we can make payment required just for the command `sync`
whatever the platform(desktop, mobile, terminal), so for instance the
whole application will be local on one device and if the user want to
sync between all our integrations, we can require a month subscription
since the sync command will call our API making easy to check if payment
was made or not.
