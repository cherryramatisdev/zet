# relearning go

I'm so happy right now that I'm learning/coding golang again, it's such an amazing language and I have an pretty awesome objective: rewrite all my scripts into go binary bonzai tree

It's so awesome the now we have stuff like [bonzai](github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) that I *finally* don't need to use cobra again, it's such an awesome package that I'm just rewriting everything in go and learning soooo much

I'm really happy right now
